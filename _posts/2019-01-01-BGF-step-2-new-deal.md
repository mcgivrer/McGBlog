# The Neaw Deal

I've received my first draft of my first book I am working on for the last half and a year: "**Developper** mon premier **jeu de plateforme** avec **Java**" !

![./images/bgf](./image/bgf/book-cover.jpg "")

It's a beautiful book (Eh, i've created it :) with the five first chapters, corresponding to the first 5 cours about **how to create a platform game with Java** (sic) on the Google Class Room service I am currently creating.
