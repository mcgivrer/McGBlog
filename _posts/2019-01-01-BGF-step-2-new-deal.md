# The Neaw Deal

I've received the first draft of my first book I am working on for the last half and a year: "**Developper** mon premier **jeu de plateforme** avec **Java**" !

Yes, the book is a french language one's, because it is my first one. I hope I will be able to write a second one later next year (2020) with more in depth things about game and their develoment.

*~~ My First Book ~~*

> The current cover image will change because of discussion with originator of used pixel graphics to illustrate my own "in-cours" game.

It's a beautiful book (Eh, i've created it :) with the 5 first chapters, corresponding to the 5 first courses about **how to create a platform game with Java** (sic) on the [Google Class Room GDJ100 course](https://classroom.google.com/c/NzI2ODQ3NjU2MFpa)  I am currently creating.

14 chapters are in the final target and would be written before end of 2019 (I hope :)
