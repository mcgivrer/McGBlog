# The Neaw Deal

I've received the first draft of my first book I am working on for the last half and a year: "**Developper** mon premier **jeu de plateforme** avec **Java**" !

Yes, the book is a french language one's, because it is my first one. I hope I will be able to write a second one later next year (2020) with more in depth things about game and their develoment.

*~~ My First Book ~~*

> The current cover image will change because of discussion with originator of used pixel graphics to illustrate my own "in-cours" game.

It's a beautiful book (Eh, i've created it :) with the 5 first chapters, corresponding to the 5 first courses about **how to create a platform game with Java** (sic) on the [Google Class Room GDJ100 course](https://classroom.google.com/c/NzI2ODQ3NjU2MFpa)  I am currently creating.

~~ Some Game Development Java oriented courses ~~

The next step consists in performing a global review of the five first chapter, and continue to write other chapters with corresponding github repositories.
14 chapters are in the final target and would be written before end of 2019 (I hope :)
